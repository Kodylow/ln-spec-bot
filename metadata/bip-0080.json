    {
      "header": "Abstract",
      "content": "This BIP defines a logical hierarchy for non-colored voting pool\ndeterministic multisig wallets based on an algorithm described in\nBIP-0032 (BIP32 from now on) and purpose scheme described in BIP-0043\n(BIP43 from now on).\n\nThis BIP is a particular application of BIP43 and is based on BIP44."
    },
    {
      "header": "Motivation",
      "content": "The hierarchy proposed in this paper allows the handling of multiple\ncoins and multiple series from a single seed."
    },
    {
      "header": "Path levels {#path_levels}",
      "content": "We define the following 4 levels in BIP32 path:\n\nm / purpose' / coin_type' / series' / address_index\n\nApostrophe in the path indicates that BIP32 hardened derivation is used.\n\nEach level has a special meaning, described in the chapters below."
    },
    {
      "header": "Purpose",
      "content": "Purpose is a constant set following the BIP43 recommendation to: the\nASCII value of \\\"80\\\" with the most signifigant bit set to indicate\nhardened derivation (0x80000050). It indicates that the subtree of this\nnode is used according to this specification.\n\nHardened derivation is used at this level."
    },
    {
      "header": "Coin type {#coin_type}",
      "content": "One master node (seed) can be used for unlimited number of independent\ncryptocoins such as Bitcoin, Litecoin or Namecoin. However, sharing the\nsame space for various cryptocoins has some disadvantages.\n\nThis level creates a separate subtree for every cryptocoin, avoiding\nreusing addresses across cryptocoins and improving privacy issues.\n\nCoin type is a constant, set for each cryptocoin. The list of registered\ncoin type constants should be obtained from BIP44.\n\nHardened derivation is used at this level."
    },
    {
      "header": "Series",
      "content": "Series are used by voting pools in order to implement FIFO cold storage.\nBy directing deposits into multiple series, the private keys for most of\nthe deposits can be kept offline, and a limited portion can be brought\nonline to process withdrawals.\n\nHardened derivation is used at this level."
    },
    {
      "header": "Index",
      "content": "Public/private keypairs are numbered from index 0 in sequentially\nincreasing manner. This number is used as child index in BIP32\nderivation.\n\nPublic keys obtained at this level of the hierarchy are used to\nconstruct multisig deposit scripts, using a schema that is shared\nbetween the members as an out-of-band contract.\n\nPublic derivation is used at this level."
