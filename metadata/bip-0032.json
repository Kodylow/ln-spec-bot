      "content": "This document describes hierarchical deterministic wallets (or \\\"HD\nWallets\\\"): wallets which can be shared partially or entirely with\ndifferent systems, each with or without the ability to spend coins.\n\nThe specification is intended to set a standard for deterministic\nwallets that can be interchanged between different clients. Although the\nwallets described here have many features, not all are required by\nsupporting clients.\n\nThe specification consists of two parts. In a first part, a system for\nderiving a tree of keypairs from a single seed is presented. The second\npart demonstrates how to build a wallet structure on top of such a tree."

      "header": "Motivation",
      "content": "The Bitcoin reference client uses randomly generated keys. In order to\navoid the necessity for a backup after every transaction, (by default)\n100 keys are cached in a pool of reserve keys. Still, these wallets are\nnot intended to be shared and used on several systems simultaneously.\nThey support hiding their private keys by using the wallet encrypt\nfeature and not sharing the password, but such \\\"neutered\\\" wallets lose\nthe power to generate public keys as well.\n\nDeterministic wallets do not require such frequent backups, and elliptic\ncurve mathematics permit schemes where one can calculate the public keys\nwithout revealing the private keys. This permits for example a webshop\nbusiness to let its webserver generate fresh addresses (public key\nhashes) for each order or for each customer, without giving the\nwebserver access to the corresponding private keys (which are required\nfor spending the received funds).\n\nHowever, deterministic wallets typically consist of a single \\\"chain\\\"\nof keypairs. The fact that there is only one chain means that sharing a\nwallet happens on an all-or-nothing basis. However, in some cases one\nonly wants some (public) keys to be shared and recoverable. In the\nexample of a webshop, the webserver does not need access to all public\nkeys of the merchant\\'s wallet; only to those addresses which are used\nto receive customer\\'s payments, and not for example the change\naddresses that are generated when the merchant spends money.\nHierarchical deterministic wallets allow such selective sharing by\nsupporting multiple keypair chains, derived from a single root."

Concatenation (\\|\\|) is the operation of appending one\nbyte sequence onto another.\n\nAs standard conversion functions, we assume:\n\n-   point(p): returns the coordinate pair resulting from EC point\nmultiplication (repeated application of the EC group operation) of\nthe secp256k1 base point with the integer p.\n-   ser~32~(i): serialize a 32-bit unsigned integer i as a 4-byte\nsequence, most significant byte first.\n-   ser~256~(p): serializes the integer p as a 32-byte sequence, most\nsignificant byte first.\n-   ser~P~(P): serializes the coordinate pair P = (x,y) as a byte\nsequence using SEC1\\'s compressed form: (0x02 or 0x03) \\|\\|\nser~256~(x), where the header byte depends on the parity of the\nomitted y coordinate.\n-   parse~256~(p): interprets a 32-byte sequence as a 256-bit number,\nmost significant byte first."

In order to prevent these from depending\nsolely on the key itself, we extend both private and public keys first\nwith an extra 256 bits of entropy. This extension, called the chain\ncode, is identical for corresponding private and public keys, and\nconsists of 32 bytes.\n\nWe represent an extended private key as (k, c), with k the normal\nprivate key, and c the chain code. An extended public key is represented\nas (K, c), with K = point(k) and c the chain code.\n\nEach extended key has 2^31^ normal child keys, and 2^31^ hardened child\nkeys. Each of these child keys has an index. The normal child keys use\nindices 0 through 2^31^-1. The hardened child keys use indices 2^31^\nthrough 2^32^-1. To ease notation for hardened key indices, a number\ni~H~ represents i+2^31^."

By evaluating\nCKDpriv(m,i) for several values of i, we get a number of level-1 derived\nnodes. As each of these is again an extended key, CKDpriv can be applied\nto those as well.\n\nTo shorten notation, we will write CKDpriv(CKDpriv(CKDpriv(m,3~H~),2),5)\nas m/3~H~/2/5. Equivalently for public keys, we write\nCKDpub(CKDpub(CKDpub(M,3),2),5) as M/3/2/5. This results in the\nfollowing identities:\n\n-   N(m/a/b/c) = N(m/a/b)/c = N(m/a)/b/c = N(m)/a/b/c = M/a/b/c.\n-   N(m/a~H~/b/c) = N(m/a~H~/b)/c = N(m/a~H~)/b/c.\n\nHowever, N(m/a~H~) cannot be rewritten as N(m)/a~H~, as the latter is\nnot possible.\n\nEach leaf node in the tree corresponds to an actual key, while the\ninternal nodes correspond to the collections of keys that descend from\nthem. The chain codes of the leaf nodes are ignored, and only their\nembedded private or public key is relevant. Because of this\nconstruction, knowing an extended private key allows reconstruction of\nall descendant private keys and public keys, and knowing an extended\npublic key allows reconstruction of all descendant non-hardened public\nkeys."
