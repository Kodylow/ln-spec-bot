      "content": "The way bitcoin transactions are normally created leaks more information\nthan desirable, and as a result has been exploited by unreasonably\neffective blockchain analysis techniques to jeopardize important\nproperties that are expected of a useful currency.\n\nBustapay is a simple and practical protocol for the sender and receiver\nof a payment to collaboratively sign a bitcoin transaction in such a way\nthat busts some analysis assumptions to the immediate benefit of the\nsender and receiver. Furthermore it does so in such a way that gives a\nsignificant amount of control to the receiver to help manage their utxo\nset size, a constant problem for bitcoin merchants."

      "header": "Motivation",
      "content": "One of the most powerful blockchain analysis heuristics has been to\nassume all inputs of a transaction are controlled by a single party\nunless otherwise known (such as by the distinctive structure of a\ntraditional coinjoin, or multisig spends that are validated onchain).\nCombined with other techniques (notably change-output guessing) this has\nlead to unexpectedly accurate tracking that has exposed bitcoin\nparticipants to unacceptable personal, business and financial risks \\--\nundermining bitcoin\\'s utility and fungibility \\-- and ultimately\njeopardizing its ability to function as useful money.\n\nWe however can bust these assumptions with a sender-receiver coinjoin.\nTo prevent costless spy/DoS attacks, we require the sending party to\nprovide a fully-valid ready-to-propagate transaction to initiate the\nprocess, that the receiver can broadcast if the sender never completes\nthe coinjoin thus tying the cost to that of spending a utxo. Most\npromisingly, bustapay transactions do not have an identifiable structure\nso any network analysis will be not able to tell if a given transaction\nis a bustapay transaction or not which erodes the confidence of their\nentire models, providing positive externalities for the entire bitcoin\necosystem.\n\nBustapay transactions also do not grow the receiver\\'s count of unspent\ntransaction outputs, and in fact gives the receiver an opportunity to\nbetter manage their utxo set, something normally only done when sending\npayments. Large utxo sets are often problematic and expensive, and\nfrequently requiring privacy-destroying consolidation. Besides busting\nclustering assumptions, bustapay also provides a layer of obfuscation of\nsend amounts.\n\nIt is worth noting that this specification has eschewed complexity and\npotentially useful extensions on the assumption that simplicity is of\nthe most important to encourage adoption."

    {
      "header": "Specification",
      "content": "The standard way of letting a sender know where to send a bustapay\ntransaction is done via a bip21 encoded address. The key value \\\"bpu\\\"\n(short for \\\"BustaPayUrl\\\") should be used. An example of such address\nwould be\n<bitcoin:2NABbUr9yeRCp1oUCtVmgJF8HGRCo3ifpTT?bpu=https://bp.bustabit.com/submit>\nIt is highly encouraged that urls are kept short.\n\nWhen the sender is creating a \\\"template transaction\\\" it is done almost\nidentically to creating a normal send, with the exception that \\*only\\*\nsegwit inputs may be used. The sender is also encouraged to use a\nslightly more aggressive feerate than usual as well as BIP125 (Opt-in\nFull Replace-by-Fee Signaling), but neither is strictly required.\n\nThe template transaction should be sent to the receiver via an HTTP POST\nto the bustapay url, with a binary encoded body.\n\nThe receiver is then responsible for validating the template\ntransaction. If there is a problem with the transaction, or the receiver\nis generally unhappy with the transaction (e.g. fees are too small) the\nHTTP response code of 422 should be used and a human-readable string\ncontaining information on why which can be directly given to the user.\n\nShould the receiver reject a transaction, it should not attempt to\npropagate it on the network. However it is important for the sender to\nbe aware that the receiver \\*could\\* at any time (regardless of which\nerror was given) send this transaction. The client should therefore\nassume the receiver will, and act accordingly (either retry with\nadjustments or just propagate the transaction). It is imperative that\nthe sender never finds themselves in a situation where two payments to\nthe sender could be valid."

      "header": "Contributed Input Choice {#contributed_input_choice}",
      "content": "The receiver must add at least one input to the transaction (the\n\\\"contributed inputs\\\"). If the receiver has no inputs, it should use a\n500 internal server error, so the client can send the transaction as per\nnormal (or try again later). Its generally advised to only add a single\ncontributed input, however they are circumstances where adding more than\na single input can be useful.\n\nTo prevent an attack where a receiver is continually sent variations of\nthe same transaction to enumerate the receivers utxo set, it is\nessential that the receiver always returns the same contributed inputs\nwhen it\\'s seen the same inputs.\n\nIt is strongly preferable that the receiver makes an effort to pick a\ncontributed input of the same type as the other transaction inputs if\npossible."

If the sender does not do this after\na reasonable time (e.g. 1 minute), the receiver should publish the\ntemplate transaction as an important anti-spy/anti-DoS tactic . The\nsender may also choose to publish the template transaction instead of\nthe final transaction if they believe the receiver to have unreasonably\nlowered the feerate of the transaction (i.e. increased the size of the\ntransaction, but not the feerate enough). And both parties can consider\npublishing the template transaction even after the finalized transaction\nis on the network (taking advantage of replace-by-fee) if the final\ntransaction is not confirming and the template transaction has more\nfees."

To keep your sanity\nmake sure all inputs are segwit. But remember segwit does not\nprevent txid malleability unless you validate the transaction. So\nreally make sure you\\'re using testmempoolaccept at the very least\n-   Bustapay could be abused by a malicious party to query if you own a\ndeposit address or not. So never accept a bustapay transaction that\npays an already used deposit address\n-   You will need to keep a mapping of which utxos people have showed\nyou and which you revealed. So if you see them again, you can reveal\nthe same one of your own\n-   Check if the transaction was already sorted according to BIP69, if\nso ensure the result stays that way. Otherwise probably just shuffle\nthe inputs/outputs\n-   A reference implementation is maintained at\n<https://github.com/rhavar/bustapay> which functions as a wrapper\naround some RPC calls to bitcoin core\\'s wallet.\n-   The sender must be careful of an attack where the receiver tries to\nadd additional inputs that are controlled by the sender, with the\nhope that the sender blindly signs it."
