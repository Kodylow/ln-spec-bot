      "header": "Motivation",
      "content": "Historically, the Bitcoin P2P protocol has not been very bandwidth\nefficient for block relay. Every transaction in a block is included when\nrelayed, even though a large number of the transactions in a given block\nare already available to nodes before the block is relayed. This causes\nmoderate inbound bandwidth spikes for nodes when receiving blocks, but\ncan cause very significant outbound bandwidth spikes for some nodes\nwhich receive a block before their peers. When such spikes occur, buffer\nbloat can make consumer-grade internet connections temporarily unusable,\nand can delay the relay of blocks to remote peers who may choose to wait\ninstead of redundantly requesting the same block from other, less\ncongested, peers.\n\nThus, decreasing the bandwidth used during block relay is very useful\nfor many individuals running nodes.\n\nWhile the goal of this work is explicitly not to reduce block transfer\nlatency, it does, as a side effect reduce block transfer latencies in\nsome rather significant ways. Additionally, this work forms a foundation\nfor future work explicitly targeting low-latency block transfer."

      "content": "### Intended Protocol Flow {#intended_protocol_flow}\n\n`<img src=bip-0152/protocol-flow.png>`{=html}`</img>`{=html}\n\nThe protocol is intended to be used in two ways, depending on the peers\nand bandwidth available, as discussed\n[later](#Implementation_Notes \"wikilink\"). The \\\"high-bandwidth\\\" mode,\nwhich nodes may only enable for a few of their peers, is enabled by\nsetting the first boolean to 1 in a `sendcmpct` message. In this mode,\npeers send new block announcements with the short transaction IDs\nalready (via a `cmpctblock` message), possibly even before fully\nvalidating the block (as indicated by the grey box in the image above).\nIn some cases no further round-trip is needed, and the receiver can\nreconstruct the block and process it as usual immediately. When some\ntransactions were not available from local sources (ie mempool), a\n`getblocktxn`/`blocktxn` roundtrip is necessary, bringing the best-case\nlatency to the same 1.5\\*RTT minimum time that nodes take today, though\nwith significantly less bandwidth usage.\n\nThe \\\"low-bandwidth\\\" mode is enabled by setting the first boolean to 0\nin a `sendcmpct` message. In this mode, peers send new block\nannouncements with the usual inv/headers announcements (as per BIP130,\nand after fully validating the block). The receiving peer may then\nrequest the block using a MSG_CMPCT_BLOCK `getdata` request, which will\nreceive a response of the header and short transaction IDs. In some\ncases no further round-trip is needed, and the receiver can reconstruct\nthe block and process it as usual, taking the same 1.5\\*RTT minimum time\nthat nodes take today, though with significantly less bandwidth usage.\nWhen some transactions were not available from local sources (ie\nmempool), a `getblocktxn`/`blocktxn` roundtrip is necessary, bringing\nthe latency to at least 2.5\\*RTT in this case, again with significantly\nless bandwidth usage than today. Because TCP often exhibits worse\ntransfer latency for larger data sizes (as a multiple of RTT), total\nlatency is expected to be reduced even when the full 2.5\\*RTT transfer\nmechanism is used."

As it is only\nin a single field, it does not allow a node to support a specific\nversion in only one direction (sending or receiving).\n2.  Upon connection establishment, a node SHOULD send a burst of\nsendcmpct messages containing every version of compact block\nencodings for which they are willing to support sending cmpctblock\nand blocktxn messages, and receiving getblocktxn messages. These\nmessages SHOULD be ordered in the order of the priority which the\nnode wishes to receive cmpctblock/blocktxn messages, with the\nhighest-priority version sendcmpct message sent first.\n3.  The encoding version used to send a cmpctblock or blocktxn message\nor to receive a getblocktxn message MUST be the second integer\n(version number) in the first sendcmpct message received for which a\nsendcmpct message with the same version number was sent.\n4.  Nodes MUST NOT send a sendcmpct message which contains a version\nnumber other than the version number which has been negotiated for\nreceiving cmpctblock/blocktxn messages after sending a request for a\nMSG_CMPCT_BLOCK object, sending a cmpctblock, getblocktxn, blocktxn,\nor pong message.\n5.  As a node must send all sendcmpct messages which contain a novel\nversion announcement before any other compact block-related\nmessages, it is possible to determine which version of compact\nblocks will be used for each object received. It is, however, not\npossible to know which version will be used to encode the response\nto a request for a compact block object before any\nMSG_CMPCT_BLOCK-containing getdata, cmpctblock, getblocktxn,\nblocktxn, or ping/pong messages have been exchanged.\n6.  Thus, if a node wishes to determine exactly which version of compact\nblocks will be used before requesting a compact block object, it\nmust send all of its sendcmpct version announcements, followed by a\nping, and wait for the pong response to ensure it has received all\nsendcmpctblock version announcement messages from the remote peer.\nNodes can, obviously, however, determine that the version used will\nbe at least a certain version (in their priority order) after having\nreceived a sendcmpct message from the remote peer containing that\nversion as the second integer."

Upon receiving the first sendcmpct announcement with a protocol\nversion which is understood from the remote peer, a node will \\\"lock\nin\\\" the compact block encoding version which will be used to encode\ncompact blocks to that peer.\n4.  The node then sets the current receive-protocol-version in use on\nthe connection to that version, and uses it to decode new compact\nblock messages.\n5.  Upon receiving subsequent sendcmpct announcements with a protocol\nversion which is understood from the remote peer (ie a version which\nhas been announced using a sendcmpct in the other direction), a node\nwill check if that protocol version is higher-receive-priority than\nthe current receive-protocol-version in use on the connection, and\nswitch to that version for decoding new compact block messages\nreceived.\n6.  A node might wish to keep a flag for each peer which indicates\ncompact block version negotiation is complete, which can be set upon\nreceiving any compact block-related, or pong message.\n7.

Nodes which\nannounce using CMPCTBLOCK message and then receive a request for\nassociated block data SHOULD ensure that messages do not go\nunresponded to, and that the appropriate data is provided after the\nblock has been validated, subject to standard message-response\nordering requirements. Note that no requirement is added that the\nnode respond to the request with the new block included in eg\nGETHEADERS or GETBLOCKS messages, but the node SHOULD re-announce\nthe block using the associated announcement methods after validation\nhas completed if it is not included in the original response. On the\nother hand, nodes SHOULD delay responding to GETDATA requests for\nthe block until validation has completed, stalling all message\nprocessing for the associated peer. REJECT messages are not\nconsidered \\\"responses\\\" for the purpose of this section.\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n1.  As a result of the above requirements, implementors may wish to\nconsider the potential for the introduction of delays in responses\nwhile remote peers validate blocks, avoiding delay-causing requests\nwhere possible."

      "content": "#### Protocol design {#protocol_design}\n\nThere have been many proposals to save wire bytes when relaying blocks.\nMany of them have a two-fold goal of reducing block relay time and thus\nrely on the use of significant processing power in order to avoid\nintroducing additional worst-case RTTs. Because this work is not focused\nprimarily on reducing block relay time, its design is much simpler (ie\ndoes not rely on set reconciliation protocols). Still, in testing at the\ntime of writing, nodes are able to relay blocks without the extra\ngetblocktxn/blocktxn RTT around 90% of the time. With a smart\ncompact-block-announcement policy, it is thus expected that this work\nmight allow blocks to be relayed between nodes in 0.5\\*RTT instead of\n1.5\\*RTT at least 75% of the time."

      "header": "Short transaction ID calculation {#short_transaction_id_calculation}",
      "content": "There are several design goals for the Short ID calculation:\n\n-   **Performance** The sender needs to compute short IDs for all block\ntransactions, and the receiver for all mempool transactions they are\nbeing compared to. As we\\'re easily talking about several thousand\ntransactions, sub-microsecond processing per-transactions is needed.\n-   **Space** cmpctblock messages are never optional in this protocol,\nand contain a short ID for each non-prefilled transaction in the\nblock. Thus, the size of short IDs is directly proportional to the\nmaximum bandwidth savings possible.\n-   **Collision resistance** It should be hard for network participants\nto create transactions that cause collisions. If an attacker were\nable to cause such collisions, filling mempools (and, thus, blocks)\nwith them would cause poor network propagation of new (or\nnon-attacker, in the case of a miner) blocks.\n\nSipHash is a secure, fast, and simple 64-bit MAC designed for network\ntraffic authentication and collision-resistant hash tables. We truncate\nthe output from SipHash-2-4 to 48 bits (see next section) in order to\nminimize space. The resulting 48-bit hash is certainly not large enough\nto avoid intentionally created individual collisons, but by using the\nblock hash as a key to SipHash, an attacker cannot predict what keys\nwill be used once their transactions are actually included in a relayed\nblock. We mix in a per-connection 64-bit nonce to obtain independent\nshort IDs on every connection, so that even block creators cannot\ncontrol where collisions occur, and random collisions only ever affect a\nsmall number of connections at any given time. The mixing is done using\nSHA256(block_header \\|\\| nonce), which is slow compared to SipHash, but\nonly done once per block. It also adds the ability for nodes to choose\nthe nonce in a better than random way to minimize collisions, though\nthat is not necessary for correct behaviour. Conversely, nodes can also\nabuse this ability to increase their ability to introduce collisions in\nthe blocks they relay themselves. However, they can already cause more\nproblems by simply refusing to relay blocks. That is inevitable, and\nthis design only seeks to prevent network-wide misbehavior."

      "content": "Thanks to the block-header-based SipHash keys, we can assume that the\nonly collisions on links between honest nodes are random ones.\n\nFor each of the *t* block transactions, the receiver will compare its\nreceived short ID with that of a set of *m* mempool transactions. We\nassume that each of those *t* has a chance *r* to be included in that\nset of *m*. If we use *B* bits short IDs, for each comparison between a\nreceived short ID and a mempool transaction, there is a chance of *P =\n1 - 1 / 2\\^B* that a mismatch is detected as such.\n\nWhen comparing a given block transaction to the whole set of mempool\ntransactions, there are 5 cases to distinguish:\n\n1.  The receiver has exactly one match, which is the correct one. This\nhas chance *r \\* P\\^(m - 1)*.\n2.  The receiver has no matches. This has chance *(1 - r) \\* P\\^m*.\n3.  The receiver has at least two matches, one of which is correct. This\nhas chance *r \\* (1 - P\\^(m - 1))*.\n4.  The receiver has at least two matches, both of which are incorrect.\nThis has chance *(1 - r) \\* (1 - P\\^m - m \\* (1 - P) \\* P\\^(m -\n1))*.\n5.  The receiver has exactly one match, but an incorrect one. This has\nchance *(1 - r) \\* m \\* (1 - P) \\* P\\^(m - 1)*.\n\n(note that these 5 numbers always add up to 100%)\n\nIn case 1, we\\'re good. In cases 2, 3, or 4, we request the full\ntransaction because we know we\\'re uncertain. Only in case 5, we fail to\nreconstruct. The chance that case 5 does not occur in any of the *t*\ntransactions in a block is *(1 - (1 - r) \\* m \\* (1 - P) \\* P\\^(m -\n1))\\^t*. This expression is well approximated by *1 - (1 - r) \\* m \\*\n(1 - P) \\* t* = *1 - (1 - r) \\* m \\* t / 2\\^B*. Thus, if we want only\none in F block transmissions between honest nodes to fail under the\nconservative *r = 0* assumption, we need *log2(F \\* m \\* t)* bits hash\nfunctions.\n\nThis means that *B = 48* bits short IDs suffice for blocks with up to *t\n= 10000* transactions, mempools up to *m = 100000* transactions, with\nfailure to reconstruct at most one in *F = 281474* blocks. Since failure\nto reconstruct just means we fall back to normal inv/header based relay,\nit isn\\'t necessary to avoid such failure completely. It just needs to\nbe sufficiently rare they have a lower impact than random transmission\nfailures (for example, network disconnection, node overloaded, \\...)."
