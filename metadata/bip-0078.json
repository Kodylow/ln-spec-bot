      "content": "When two parties (later referred to as sender and receiver) want to\ntransact, most of the time, the sender creates a transaction spending\ntheir own Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs), signs it and broadcasts\nit on the network.\n\nThis simple model gave birth to several heuristics impacting the privacy\nof the parties and of the network as a whole.\n\n-   Common input ownership heuristic: In most transactions, all the\ninputs belong to the same party.\n-   Change identification from scriptPubKey type: If all inputs are\nspending UTXOs of a certain scriptPubKey type, then the change\noutput is likely to have the same scriptPubKey type, too.\n-   Change identification from round amount: If an output in the\ntransaction has a round amount, it is likely an output belonging to\nthe receiver.\n\nWe will designate these three heuristics as `common-input`,\n`change-scriptpubkey`, `change-round-amount`.\n\nThe problems we aim to solve are:\n\n-   For the receiver, there is a missed opportunity to consolidate their\nown UTXOs or making payment in the sender\\'s transaction.\n-   For the sender, there are privacy leaks regarding their wallet that\nhappen when someone applies the heuristics detailed above to their\ntransaction.\n\nOur proposal gives an opportunity for the receiver to consolidate their\nUTXOs while also batching their own payments, without creating a new\ntransaction. (Saving fees in the process) For the sender, it allows them\nto invalidate the three heuristics above. With the receiver\\'s\ninvolvement, the heuristics can even be poisoned. (ie, using the\nheuristics to intentionally mislead blockchain analysis)\n\nNote that the existence of this proposal is also improving the privacy\nof parties who are not using it by making the three heuristics\nunreliable to the network as a whole."

We call this PSBT the\n`original`.\n-   The receiver replies back with a signed PSBT containing his own\nsigned inputs/outputs and those of the sender. We call this PSBT\n`Payjoin proposal`.\n-   The sender verifies the proposal, re-signs his inputs and broadcasts\nthe transaction to the Bitcoin network. We call this transaction\n`Payjoin transaction`.\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n+----------+                        +--------+         +-----------------+\n| Receiver |                        | Sender |         | Bitcoin Network |\n+----+-----+                        +---+----+         +-------+---------+\n|       +-----------------+        |                      |\n+-------+ BIP21 with ?pj= +------->+                      |\n|       +-----------------+        |                      |\n|                                  |                      |\n|        +---------------+         |                      |\n+<-------+ Original PSBT +---------+                      |\n|        +---------------+         |                      |\n|                                  |                      |\n|       +------------------+       |                      |\n|       | Payjoin Proposal |       |                      |\n+-------+      PSBT        +------>+                      |\n|       +------------------+       |                      |\n|                                  |   +--------------+   |\n|                                  |---+ Payjoin      |   |\n|                                  |   | transaction  +-->+\n|                                  |   +--------------+   |\n+                                  +                      +\n\nThe original PSBT is sent in the HTTP POST request body, base64\nserialized, with `text/plain` in the `Content-Type` HTTP header and\n`Content-Length` set correctly.

To prevent this, the sender can agree\nto pay more fee so the receiver make sure that the payjoin transaction\nfee is also round.\n\n-   The sender\\'s transaction is time sensitive.\n\nWhen a sender pick a specific fee rate, the sender expects the\ntransaction to be confirmed after a specific amount of time.
