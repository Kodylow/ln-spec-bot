      "content": "This BIP defines a new structure called a \\\"witness\\\" that is committed\nto blocks separately from the transaction merkle tree. This structure\ncontains data required to check transaction validity but not required to\ndetermine transaction effects. In particular, scripts and signatures are\nmoved into this new structure.\n\nThe witness is committed in a tree that is nested into the block\\'s\nexisting merkle root via the coinbase transaction for the purpose of\nmaking this BIP soft fork compatible. A future hard fork can place this\ntree in its own branch."

    {
      "header": "Motivation",
      "content": "The entirety of the transaction\\'s effects are determined by output\nconsumption (spends) and new output creation. Other transaction data,\nand signatures in particular, are only required to validate the\nblockchain state, not to determine it.\n\nBy removing this data from the transaction structure committed to the\ntransaction merkle tree, several problems are fixed:\n\n1.  **Nonintentional malleability becomes impossible**. Since signature\ndata is no longer part of the transaction hash, changes to how the\ntransaction was signed are no longer relevant to transaction\nidentification. As a solution of transaction malleability, this is\nsuperior to the canonical signature approach\n([BIP62](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0062.mediawiki)):\n-   It prevents involuntary transaction malleability for any type of\nscripts, as long as all inputs are signed (with at least one\nCHECKSIG or CHECKMULTISIG operation)\n-   In the case of an m-of-n CHECKMULTISIG script, a transaction is\nmalleable only with agreement of m private key holders (as\nopposed to only 1 private key holder with BIP62)\n-   It prevents involuntary transaction malleability due to unknown\nECDSA signature malleability\n-   It allows creation of unconfirmed transaction dependency chains\nwithout counterparty risk, an important feature for offchain\nprotocols such as the Lightning Network\n2.  **Transmission of signature data becomes optional**. It is needed\nonly if a peer is trying to validate a transaction instead of just\nchecking its existence. This reduces the size of SPV proofs and\npotentially improves the privacy of SPV clients as they can download\nmore transactions using the same bandwidth.\n3.  **Some constraints could be bypassed with a soft fork** by moving\npart of the transaction data to a structure unknown to current\nprotocol, for example:\n-   Size of witness could be ignored / discounted when calculating\nthe block size, effectively increasing the block size to some\nextent\n-   Hard coded constants, such as maximum data push size (520 bytes)\nor sigops limit could be reevaluated or removed\n-   New script system could be introduced without any limitation\nfrom the existing script semantic. For example, a new\ntransaction digest algorithm for transaction signature\nverification is described in\n[BIP143](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0143.mediawiki)"

These backlinks consist of a block hash and an offset that\nthin clients can easily query and check to verify that the outputs\nexist.\n\nThese commitments could be included in the extensible commitment\nstructure through a soft fork and will be transparent to nodes that do\nnot understand such new rules."

The\nwitness as a structure is not restricted by any existing script\nsemantics and constraints, the 520-byte push limit in particular, and\ntherefore allows arbitrarily large scripts and signatures.\n\nExamples of new script system include Schnorr signatures which reduce\nthe size of multisig transactions dramatically, Lamport signature which\nis quantum computing resistance, and Merklized abstract syntax trees\nwhich allow very compact witness for conditional scripts with extreme\ncomplexity."

However,\na scriptPubKey with OP_0 followed by a 41-byte non-zero data push\nwill pass, since it is not considered to be a witness program\n\n[^2]: For backward compatibility, for any version byte from 0 to 16, the\nscript must fail if the witness program has a `CastToBool` value of\nzero. However, having a hash like this is a successful preimage\nattack against the hash function, and the risk is negligible.\n\n[^3]: Rationale of using a single composite constraint, instead of two\nseparate limits such as 1MB base data and 3MB witness data: Using\ntwo separate limits would make mining and fee estimation nearly\nimpossible. Miners would need to solve a complex non-linear\noptimization problem to find the set of transactions that maximize\nfees given both constraints, and wallets would not be able to know\nwhat to pay as it depends on which of the two conditions is most\nconstrained by the time miners try to produce blocks with their\ntransactions in. Another problem with such an approach is\nfreeloading. Once a set of transactions hit the base data 1MB\nconstraint, up to 3MB extra data could be added to the witness by\njust minimally increasing the fee. The marginal cost for extra\nwitness space effectively becomes zero in that case.\n\n[^4]: <https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2016-August/013014.html>"
