      "content": "For most of its history, Bitcoin has relied on base58 addresses with a\ntruncated double-SHA256 checksum. They were part of the original\nsoftware and their scope was extended in\n[BIP13](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0013.mediawiki)\nfor Pay-to-script-hash\n([P2SH](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0016.mediawiki)).\nHowever, both the character set and the checksum algorithm have\nlimitations:\n\n-   Base58 needs a lot of space in QR codes, as it cannot use the\n*alphanumeric mode*.\n-   The mixed case in base58 makes it inconvenient to reliably write\ndown, type on mobile keyboards, or read out loud.\n-   The double SHA256 checksum is slow and has no error-detection\nguarantees.\n-   Most of the research on error-detecting codes only applies to\ncharacter-set sizes that are a [prime\npower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_power), which 58 is not.\n-   Base58 decoding is complicated and relatively slow.\n\nIncluded in the Segregated Witness proposal are a new class of outputs\n(witness programs, see\n[BIP141](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki)),\nand two instances of it (\\\"P2WPKH\\\" and \\\"P2WSH\\\", see\n[BIP143](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0143.mediawiki)).\nTheir functionality is available indirectly to older clients by\nembedding in P2SH outputs, but for optimal efficiency and security it is\nbest to use it directly. In this document we propose a new address\nformat for native witness outputs (current and future versions).\n\nThis replaces\n[BIP142](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0142.mediawiki),\nand was previously discussed\n[here](https://bitcoincore.org/logs/2016-05-zurich-meeting-notes.html#base32)\n(summarized\n[here](https://bitcoincore.org/en/meetings/2016/05/20/#error-correcting-codes-for-future-address-types))."

      "content": "A Bech32[^2] string is at most 90 characters long and consists of:\n\n-   The **human-readable part**, which is intended to convey the type of\ndata, or anything else that is relevant to the reader. This part\nMUST contain 1 to 83 US-ASCII characters, with each character having\na value in the range \\[33-126\\]. HRP validity may be further\nrestricted by specific applications.\n-   The **separator**, which is always \\\"1\\\". In case \\\"1\\\" is allowed\ninside the human-readable part, the last one in the string is the\nseparator`<ref>`{=html}**Why include a separator in addresses?**\nThat way the human-readable\n\npart is unambiguously separated from the data part, avoiding potential\ncollisions with other human-readable parts that share a prefix. It also\nallows us to avoid having character-set restrictions on the\nhuman-readable part. The separator is *1* because using a\nnon-alphanumeric character would complicate copy-pasting of addresses\n(with no double-click selection in several applications). Therefore an\nalphanumeric character outside the normal character set was chosen.\n\n```{=html}\n</ref>\n```\n.\n\n-   The **data part**, which is at least 6 characters long and only\nconsists of alphanumeric characters excluding \\\"1\\\", \\\"b\\\", \\\"i\\\",\nand \\\"o\\\"`<ref>`{=html}**Why not use an existing character set like\n[RFC3548](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3548.html) or\n[z-base-32](https://philzimmermann.com/docs/human-oriented-base-32-encoding.txt)**?\n\nThe character set is chosen to minimize ambiguity according to\n[this](https://hissa.nist.gov/~black/GTLD/) visual similarity data, and\nthe ordering is chosen to minimize the number of pairs of similar\ncharacters (according to the same data) that differ in more than 1 bit.\nAs the checksum is chosen to maximize detection capabilities for low\nnumbers of bit errors, this choice improves its performance under some\nerror models.\n\n```{=html}\n</ref>\n```\n.\n\n0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7\n----- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---\n+0    q   p   z   r   y   9   x   8\n+8    g   f   2   t   v   d   w   0\n+16   s   3   j   n   5   4   k   h\n+24   c   e   6   m   u   a   7   l\n\n**Checksum**\n\nThe last six characters of the data part form a checksum and contain no\ninformation. Valid strings MUST pass the criteria for validity specified\nby the Python3 code snippet below. The function `bech32_verify_checksum`\nmust return true when its arguments are:\n\n-   `hrp`: the human-readable part as a string\n-   `data`: the data part as a list of integers representing the\ncharacters after conversion using the table above\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\ndef bech32_polymod(values):\nGEN = [0x3b6a57b2, 0x26508e6d, 0x1ea119fa, 0x3d4233dd, 0x2a1462b3]\nchk = 1\nfor v in values:\nb = (chk >> 25)\nchk = (chk & 0x1ffffff) << 5 ^ v\nfor i in range(5):\nchk ^= GEN[i] if ((b >> i) & 1) else 0\nreturn chk\n\ndef bech32_hrp_expand(s):\nreturn [ord(x) >> 5 for x in s] + [0] + [ord(x) & 31 for x in s]\n\ndef bech32_verify_checksum(hrp, data):\nreturn bech32_polymod(bech32_hrp_expand(hrp) + data) == 1\n\nThis implements a [BCH code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCH_code)\nthat guarantees detection of **any error affecting at most 4\ncharacters** and has less than a 1 in 10^9^ chance of failing to detect\nmore errors. More details about the properties can be found in the\nChecksum Design appendix. The human-readable part is processed by first\nfeeding the higher bits of each character\\'s US-ASCII value into the\nchecksum calculation followed by a zero and then the lower bits of\neach[^3].\n\nTo construct a valid checksum given the human-readable part and\n(non-checksum) values of the data-part characters, the code below can be\nused:\n\ndef bech32_create_checksum(hrp, data):\nvalues = bech32_hrp_expand(hrp) + data\npolymod = bech32_polymod(values + [0,0,0,0,0,0]) ^ 1\nreturn [(polymod >> 5 * (5 - i)) & 31 for i in range(6)]\n\n**Error correction**\n\nOne of the properties of these BCH codes is that they can be used for\nerror correction. An unfortunate side effect of error correction is that\nit erodes error detection: correction changes invalid inputs into valid\ninputs, but if more than a few errors were made then the valid input may\nnot be the correct input. Use of an incorrect but valid input can cause\nfunds to be lost irrecoverably. Because of this, implementations SHOULD\nNOT implement correction beyond potentially suggesting to the user where\nin the string an error might be found, without suggesting the correction\nto make.\n\n**Uppercase/lowercase**\n\nThe lowercase form is used when determining a character\\'s value for\nchecksum purposes.\n\nEncoders MUST always output an all lowercase Bech32 string. If an\nuppercase version of the encoding result is desired, (e.g.- for\npresentation purposes, or QR code use), then an uppercasing procedure\ncan be performed external to the encoding process.\n\nDecoders MUST NOT accept strings where some characters are uppercase and\nsome are lowercase (such strings are referred to as mixed case strings).\n\nFor presentation, lowercase is usually preferable, but inside QR codes\nuppercase SHOULD be used, as those permit the use of *[alphanumeric\nmode](http://www.thonky.com/qr-code-tutorial/alphanumeric-mode-encoding)*,\nwhich is 45% more compact than the normal *[byte\nmode](http://www.thonky.com/qr-code-tutorial/byte-mode-encoding)*."

      "content": "**Design choices**\n\nBCH codes can be constructed over any prime-power alphabet and can be\nchosen to have a good trade-off between size and error-detection\ncapabilities. While most work around BCH codes uses a binary alphabet,\nthat is not a requirement. This makes them more appropriate for our use\ncase than [CRC\ncodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check). Unlike\n[Reed-Solomon\ncodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%E2%80%93Solomon_error_correction),\nthey are not restricted in length to one less than the alphabet size.\nWhile they also support efficient error correction, the implementation\nof just error detection is very simple.\n\nWe pick 6 checksum characters as a trade-off between length of the\naddresses and the error-detection capabilities, as 6 characters is the\nlowest number sufficient for a random failure chance below 1 per\nbillion. For the length of data we\\'re interested in protecting (up to\n71 bytes for a potential future 40-byte witness program), BCH codes can\nbe constructed that guarantee detecting up to 4 errors.\n\n**Selected properties**\n\nMany of these codes perform badly when dealing with more errors than\nthey are designed to detect, but not all. For that reason, we consider\ncodes that are designed to detect only 3 errors as well as 4 errors, and\nanalyse how well they perform in practice.\n\nThe specific code chosen here is the result of:\n\n-   Starting with an exhaustive list of 159605 BCH codes designed to\ndetect 3 or 4 errors up to length 93, 151, 165, 341, 1023, and 1057.\n-   From those, requiring the detection of 4 errors up to length 71,\nresulting in 28825 remaining codes.\n-   From those, choosing the codes with the best worst-case window for\n5-character errors, resulting in 310 remaining codes.\n-   From those, picking the code with the lowest chance for not\ndetecting small numbers of *bit* errors.\n\nAs a naive search would require over 6.5 \\* 10^19^ checksum evaluations,\na collision-search approach was used for analysis. The code can be found\n[here](https://github.com/sipa/ezbase32/).\n\n**Properties**\n\nThe following table summarizes the chances for detection failure (as\nmultiples of 1 in 10^9^).\n\nWindow length   \n--------------- --------------------------------------\nLength          Description\n8               Longest detecting 6 errors\n18              Longest detecting 5 errors\n19              Worst case for 6 errors\n39              Length for a P2WPKH address\n59              Length for a P2WSH address\n71              Length for a 40-byte program address\n89              Longest detecting 4 errors\n\nThis means that when 5 changed characters occur randomly distributed in\nthe 39 characters of a P2WPKH address, there is a chance of *0.756 per\nbillion* that it will go undetected. When those 5 changes occur randomly\nwithin a 19-character window, that chance goes down to *0.093 per\nbillion*. As the number of errors goes up, the chance converges towards\n*1 in 2^30^* = *0.931 per billion*.\n\nEven though the chosen code performs reasonably well up to 1023\ncharacters, other designs are preferable for lengths above 89 characters\n(excluding the separator)."

It does come\nwith a 15% length increase, but that does not matter when\ncopy-pasting addresses.\n\n[^2]: **Why call it Bech32?** \\\"Bech\\\" contains the characters BCH (the\nerror detection algorithm used) and sounds a bit like \\\"base\\\".\n\n[^3]: **Why are the high bits of the human-readable part processed\nfirst?** This results in the actually checksummed data being *\\[high\nhrp\\] 0 \\[low hrp\\] \\[data\\]*. This means that under the assumption\nthat errors to the human readable part only change the low 5 bits\n(like changing an alphabetical character into another), errors are\nrestricted to the *\\[low hrp\\] \\[data\\]* part, which is at most 89\ncharacters, and thus all error detection properties (see appendix)\nremain applicable.\n\n[^4]: **Why not make an address format that is generic for all\nscriptPubKeys?** That would lead to confusion about addresses for\nexisting scriptPubKey types. Furthermore, if addresses that do not\nhave a one-to-one mapping with scriptPubKeys (such as ECDH-based\naddresses) are ever introduced, having a fully generic old address\ntype available would permit reinterpreting the resulting\nscriptPubKeys using the old address format, with lost funds as a\nresult if bitcoins are sent to them.\n\n[^5]: **Why use \\'bc\\' as human-readable part and not \\'btc\\'?** \\'bc\\'\nis shorter."
