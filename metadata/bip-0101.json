      "header": "Rationale",
      "content": "The initial size of 8,000,000 bytes was chosen after testing the current\nreference implementation code with larger block sizes and receiving\nfeedback from miners on bandwidth-constrained networks (in particular,\nChinese miners behind the Great Firewall of China).\n\nThe doubling interval was chosen based on long-term growth trends for\nCPU power, storage, and Internet bandwidth. The 20-year limit was chosen\nbecause exponential growth cannot continue forever. If long-term trends\ndo not continue, maximum block sizes can be reduced by miner consensus\n(a soft-fork).\n\nCalculations are based on timestamps and not blockchain height because a\ntimestamp is part of every block\\'s header. This allows implementations\nto know a block\\'s maximum size after they have downloaded it\\'s header,\nbut before downloading any transactions.\n\nThe deployment plan is taken from Jeff Garzik\\'s proposed BIP100 block\nsize increase, and is designed to give miners, merchants, and\nfull-node-running-end-users sufficient time to upgrade to software that\nsupports bigger blocks. A 75% supermajority was chosen so that one large\nmining pool does not have effective veto power over a blocksize\nincrease. The version number scheme is designed to be compatible with\nPieter\\'s Wuille\\'s proposed \\\"Version bits\\\" BIP, and to not interfere\nwith any other consensus rule changes in the process of being rolled\nout."

Increasing the capacity of the network to handle\ntransactions by increasing the maximum block size may accelerate that\ndecline, meaning a less distributed network that is more vulnerable to\ndisruption. The size of this effect is debatable; the author of this BIP\nbelieves that the decline in fully validating nodes on the network is\nlargely due to the availability of convenient, attractive, secure,\nlightweight wallet software and the general trend away from computing on\ndesktop computers to mobile phones and tablets.\n\nIncreasing the capacity of the network to handle transactions should\nenable increased adoption by users and businesses, especially in areas\nof the world where existing financial infrastructure is weak. That could\nlead to a more robust network with nodes running in more political\njurisdictions."

      "header": "Centralization of mining: costs {#centralization_of_mining_costs}",
      "content": "Miners benefit from low-latency, high-bandwidth connections because they\nincrease their chances of winning a \\\"block race\\\" (two or more blocks\nfound at approximately the same time). With the current peer-to-peer\nnetworking protocol, announcing larger blocks requires more bandwidth.\nIf the costs grow high enough, the result will be a very small number of\nvery large miners.\n\nThe limits proposed by this BIP are designed so that running a fully\nvalidating node has very modest costs, which, if current trends in the\ncost of technology continue, will become even less expensive over time."

Larger blocks increase the advantage of miners with\nhigh-bandwidth connections, although that advantage can be minimized\nwith changes to the way new blocks are announced (e.g.\n<http://bitcoinrelaynetwork.org/> ).\n\nIf latency and bandwidth to other miners were the only variable that\naffected the profitability of mining, and miners were driven purely by\nprofit, the end result would be one miner running on one machine, where\nlatency was zero and bandwidth was essentially infinite.\n\nHowever, many other factors influence miner profitability, including\ncost of electricity and labor and real estate, ability to use waste heat\nproductively, access to capital to invest in mining equipment, etc.\nIncreasing the influence of bandwidth in the mining profitability\nequation will not necessarily lead to more centralization."

It is more complex to implement, because the maximum\nallowed size for a block depends on information contained in coinbase\ntransactions from previous blocks (which may not be immediately known if\nblock contents are being fetched out-of-order in a \\'headers-first\\'\nmode).\n\n[Meni Rosenfeld has\nproposed](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1078521.0) that miners\nsacrifice mining reward to \\\"pay for\\\" bigger blocks, so there is an\nincentive to create bigger blocks only if transaction fees cover the\ncost of creating a larger block. This proposal is significantly more\ncomplex to implement, and it is not clear if a set of parameters for\nsetting the cost of making a block bigger can be found that is not\nequivalent to a centrally-controlled network-wide minimum transaction\nfee."
