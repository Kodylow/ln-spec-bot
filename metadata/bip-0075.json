It allows the requester (Sender) of a PaymentRequest to voluntarily\nsign the original request and provide a certificate to allow the\npayee to know the identity of who they are transacting with.\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n1.  It encrypts the PaymentRequest that is returned, before handing it\noff to the SSL/TLS layer to prevent man in the middle viewing of the\nPayment Request details.\n\nThe key words \\\"MUST\\\", \\\"MUST NOT\\\", \\\"REQUIRED\\\", \\\"SHALL\\\", \\\"SHALL\nNOT\\\", \\\"SHOULD\\\", \\\"SHOULD NOT\\\", \\\"RECOMMENDED\\\", \\\"MAY\\\", and\n\\\"OPTIONAL\\\" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC\n2119."

      "header": "Motivation",
      "content": "The motivation for defining this extension to the\n[BIP70](bip-0070.mediawiki \"wikilink\") Payment Protocol is to allow two\nparties to exchange payment information in a permissioned and encrypted\nway, such that wallet address communication can become a more automated\nprocess. This extension also expands the types of PKI (public-key\ninfrastructure) data that is supported, and allows it to be shared by\nboth parties (with [BIP70](bip-0070.mediawiki \"wikilink\"), only the\nreceiver could provide PKI information). This allows for automated\ncreation of off-blockchain transaction logs that are human readable, now\nincluding information about the sender and not just the recipient.\n\nThe motivation for this extension to\n[BIP70](bip-0070.mediawiki \"wikilink\") is threefold:\n\n1.  Ensure that the payment details can only be seen by the participants\nin the transaction, and not by any third party.\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n1.  Enhance the Payment Protocol to allow for store and forward servers\nin order to allow, for example, mobile wallets to sign and serve\nPayment Requests.\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n1.  Allow a sender of funds the option of sharing their identity with\nthe receiver. This information could then be used to:"

      "header": "Example Use Cases {#example_use_cases}",
      "content": "1\\. Address Book\n\nA Bitcoin wallet developer would like to offer the ability to store an\n\\\"address book\\\" of payees, so users could send multiple payments to\nknown entities without having to request an address every time. Static\naddresses compromise privacy, and address reuse is considered a security\nrisk. BIP32 X-Pubs allow the generation of unique addresses, but\nwatching an X-Pub chain for each person you wish to receive funds from\nis too resource-intensive for mobile applications, and there is always a\nrisk of unknowingly sending funds to an X-Pub address after the owner\nhas lost access to the corresponding private key.\n\nWith this BIP, Bitcoin wallets could maintain an \\\"address book\\\" that\nonly needs to store each payee\\'s public key. Adding an entry to one\\'s\naddress book could be done by using a Wallet Name, scanning a QR code,\nsending a URI through a text message or e-mail, or searching a public\nrepository. When the user wishes to make a payment, their wallet would\ndo all the work in the background to communicate with the payee\\'s\nwallet to receive a unique payment address. If the payee\\'s wallet has\nbeen lost, replaced, or destroyed, no communication will be possible,\nand the sending of funds to a \\\"dead\\\" address is prevented.\n\n2\\. Individual Permissioned Address Release\n\nA Bitcoin wallet developer would like to allow users to view a potential\nsending party\\'s identifying information before deciding whether or not\nto share payment information with them. Currently,\n[BIP70](bip-0070.mediawiki \"wikilink\") shares the receiver's payment\naddress and identity information with anyone who requests it.\n\nWith this BIP, Bitcoin wallets could use the sender's identifying\ninformation to make a determination of whether or not to share their own\ninformation. This gives the receiving party more control over who\nreceives their payment and identity information. Additionally, this\ncould be used to automatically provide new payment addresses to\nwhitelisted senders, or to protect users' privacy from unsolicited\npayment requests.\n\n3\\. Using Store & Forward Servers\n\nA Bitcoin wallet developer would like to use a public Store & Forward\nservice for an asynchronous address exchange. This is a common case for\nmobile and offline wallets.\n\nWith this BIP, returned payment information is encrypted with an\nECDH-computed shared key before sending to a Store & Forward service. In\nthis case, a successful attack against a Store & Forward service would\nnot be able to read or modify wallet address or payment information,\nonly delete encrypted messages."
