      "content": "Bitcoin has traditionally used\n[ECDSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm)\nsignatures over the [secp256k1 curve](https://www.secg.org/sec2-v2.pdf)\nwith [SHA256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) hashes for\nauthenticating transactions. These are\n[standardized](https://www.secg.org/sec1-v2.pdf), but have a number of\ndownsides compared to [Schnorr\nsignatures](http://publikationen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/opus4/files/4280/schnorr.pdf)\nover the same curve:\n\n-   **Provable security**: Schnorr signatures are provably secure. In\nmore detail, they are *strongly unforgeable under chosen message\nattack (SUF-CMA)*[^1] [in the random oracle model assuming the\nhardness of the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem\n(ECDLP)](https://www.di.ens.fr/~pointche/Documents/Papers/2000_joc.pdf)\nand [in the generic group model assuming variants of preimage and\nsecond preimage resistance of the used hash\nfunction](http://www.neven.org/papers/schnorr.pdf)[^2]. In contrast,\nthe [best known results for the provable security of\nECDSA](https://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:hbz:294-60803) rely on\nstronger assumptions.\n-   **Non-malleability**: The SUF-CMA security of Schnorr signatures\nimplies that they are non-malleable. On the other hand, ECDSA\nsignatures are inherently malleable[^3]; a third party without\naccess to the secret key can alter an existing valid signature for a\ngiven public key and message into another signature that is valid\nfor the same key and message. This issue is discussed in\n[BIP62](bip-0062.mediawiki \"wikilink\") and\n[BIP146](bip-0146.mediawiki \"wikilink\").\n-   **Linearity**: Schnorr signatures provide a simple and efficient\nmethod that enables multiple collaborating parties to produce a\nsignature that is valid for the sum of their public keys. This is\nthe building block for various higher-level constructions that\nimprove efficiency and privacy, such as multisignatures and others\n(see Applications below).\n\nFor all these advantages, there are virtually no disadvantages, apart\nfrom not being standardized. This document seeks to change that. As we\npropose a new standard, a number of improvements not specific to Schnorr\nsignatures can be made:\n\n-   **Signature encoding**: Instead of using\n[DER](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.690#DER_encoding)-encoding for\nsignatures (which are variable size, and up to 72 bytes), we can use\na simple fixed 64-byte format.\n-   **Public key encoding**: Instead of using\n[*compressed*](https://www.secg.org/sec1-v2.pdf) 33-byte encodings\nof elliptic curve points which are common in Bitcoin today, public\nkeys in this proposal are encoded as 32 bytes.\n-   **Batch verification**: The specific formulation of ECDSA signatures\nthat is standardized cannot be verified more efficiently in batch\ncompared to individually, unless additional witness data is added.\nChanging the signature scheme offers an opportunity to address this.\n-   **Completely specified**: To be safe for usage in consensus systems,\nthe verification algorithm must be completely specified at the byte\nlevel. This guarantees that nobody can construct a signature that is\nvalid to some verifiers but not all. This is traditionally not a\nrequirement for digital signature schemes, and the lack of exact\nspecification for the DER parsing of ECDSA signatures has caused\nproblems for Bitcoin [in the\npast](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-July/009697.html),\nneeding [BIP66](bip-0066.mediawiki \"wikilink\") to address it. In\nthis document we aim to meet this property by design. For batch\nverification, which is inherently non-deterministic as the verifier\ncan choose their batches, this property implies that the outcome of\nverification may only differ from individual verifications with\nnegligible probability, even to an attacker who intentionally tries\nto make batch- and non-batch verification differ.\n\nBy reusing the same curve and hash function as Bitcoin uses for ECDSA,\nwe are able to retain existing mechanisms for choosing secret and public\nkeys, and we avoid introducing new assumptions about the security of\nelliptic curves and hash functions."

      "content": "**Schnorr signature variant** Elliptic Curve Schnorr signatures for\nmessage *m* and public key *P* generally involve a point *R*, integers\n*e* and *s* picked by the signer, and the base point *G* which satisfy\n*e = hash(R \\|\\| m)* and *s\u22c5G = R + e\u22c5P*. Two formulations exist,\ndepending on whether the signer reveals *e* or *R*:\n\n1.  Signatures are pairs *(e, s)* that satisfy *e = hash(s\u22c5G - e\u22c5P \\|\\|\nm)*. This variant avoids minor complexity introduced by the encoding\nof the point *R* in the signature (see paragraphs \\\"Encoding R and\npublic key point P\\\" and \\\"Implicit Y coordinates\\\" further below in\nthis subsection). Moreover, revealing *e* instead of *R* allows for\npotentially shorter signatures: Whereas an encoding of *R*\ninherently needs about 32 bytes, the hash *e* can be tuned to be\nshorter than 32 bytes, and [a short hash of only 16 bytes suffices\nto provide SUF-CMA security at the target security level of 128\nbits](http://www.neven.org/papers/schnorr.pdf). However, a major\ndrawback of this optimization is that finding collisions in a short\nhash function is easy. This complicates the implementation of secure\nsigning protocols in scenarios in which a group of mutually\ndistrusting signers work together to produce a single joint\nsignature (see Applications below). In these scenarios, which are\nnot captured by the SUF-CMA model due its assumption of a single\nhonest signer, a promising attack strategy for malicious co-signers\nis to find a collision in the hash function in order to obtain a\nvalid signature on a message that an honest co-signer did not intend\nto sign.\n2.  Signatures are pairs *(R, s)* that satisfy *s\u22c5G = R + hash(R \\|\\|\nm)\u22c5P*. This supports batch verification, as there are no elliptic\ncurve operations inside the hashes. Batch verification enables\nsignificant speedups.[^4]\n\nSince we would like to avoid the fragility that comes with short hashes,\nthe *e* variant does not provide significant advantages. We choose the\n*R*-option, which supports batch verification.\n\n**Key prefixing** Using the verification rule above directly makes\nSchnorr signatures vulnerable to \\\"related-key attacks\\\" in which a\nthird party can convert a signature *(R, s)* for public key *P* into a\nsignature *(R, s + a\u22c5hash(R \\|\\| m))* for public key *P + a\u22c5G* and the\nsame message *m*, for any given additive tweak *a* to the signing key.\nThis would render signatures insecure when keys are generated using\n[BIP32\\'s unhardened\nderivation](bip-0032.mediawiki#public-parent-key--public-child-key \"wikilink\")\nand other methods that rely on additive tweaks to existing keys such as\nTaproot.\n\nTo protect against these attacks, we choose *key prefixed*[^5] Schnorr\nsignatures which means that the public key is prefixed to the message in\nthe challenge hash input. This changes the equation to *s\u22c5G = R + hash(R\n\\|\\| P \\|\\| m)\u22c5P*. [It can be\nshown](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1135.pdf) that key prefixing\nprotects against related-key attacks with additive tweaks. In general,\nkey prefixing increases robustness in multi-user settings, e.g., it\nseems to be a requirement for proving the MuSig multisignature scheme\nsecure (see Applications below).\n\nWe note that key prefixing is not strictly necessary for transaction\nsignatures as used in Bitcoin currently, because signed transactions\nindirectly commit to the public keys already, i.e., *m* contains a\ncommitment to *pk*. However, this indirect commitment should not be\nrelied upon because it may change with proposals such as SIGHASH_NOINPUT\n([BIP118](bip-0118.mediawiki \"wikilink\")), and would render the\nsignature scheme unsuitable for other purposes than signing\ntransactions, e.g., [signing ordinary\nmessages](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#signmessage).\n\n**Encoding R and public key point P** There exist several possibilities\nfor encoding elliptic curve points:\n\n1.  Encoding the full X and Y coordinates of *P* and *R*, resulting in a\n64-byte public key and a 96-byte signature.\n2.  Encoding the full X coordinate and one bit of the Y coordinate to\ndetermine one of the two possible Y coordinates. This would result\nin 33-byte public keys and 65-byte signatures.\n3.  Encoding only the X coordinate, resulting in 32-byte public keys and\n64-byte signatures.\n\nUsing the first option would be slightly more efficient for verification\n(around 10%), but we prioritize compactness, and therefore choose option\n3.\n\n**Implicit Y coordinates** In order to support efficient verification\nand batch verification, the Y coordinate of *P* and of *R* cannot be\nambiguous (every valid X coordinate has two possible Y coordinates). We\nhave a choice between several options for symmetry breaking:\n\n1.  Implicitly choosing the Y coordinate that is in the lower half.\n2.  Implicitly choosing the Y coordinate that is even[^6].\n3.  Implicitly choosing the Y coordinate that is a quadratic residue\n(i.e. has a square root modulo *p*).\n\nThe second option offers the greatest compatibility with existing key\ngeneration systems, where the standard 33-byte compressed public key\nformat consists of a byte indicating the oddness of the Y coordinate,\nplus the full X coordinate. To avoid gratuitous incompatibilities, we\npick that option for *P*, and thus our X-only public keys become\nequivalent to a compressed public key that is the X-only key prefixed by\nthe byte 0x02. For consistency, the same is done for *R*[^7].\n\nDespite halving the size of the set of valid public keys, implicit Y\ncoordinates are not a reduction in security. Informally, if a fast\nalgorithm existed to compute the discrete logarithm of an X-only public\nkey, then it could also be used to compute the discrete logarithm of a\nfull public key: apply it to the X coordinate, and then optionally\nnegate the result. This shows that breaking an X-only public key can be\nat most a small constant term faster than breaking a full one.[^8].\n\n**Tagged Hashes** Cryptographic hash functions are used for multiple\npurposes in the specification below and in Bitcoin in general. To make\nsure hashes used in one context can\\'t be reinterpreted in another one,\nhash functions can be tweaked with a context-dependent tag name, in such\na way that collisions across contexts can be assumed to be infeasible.\nSuch collisions obviously can not be ruled out completely, but only for\nschemes using tagging with a unique name. As for other schemes\ncollisions are at least less likely with tagging than without.\n\nFor example, without tagged hashing a BIP340 signature could also be\nvalid for a signature scheme where the only difference is that the\narguments to the hash function are reordered. Worse, if the BIP340 nonce\nderivation function was copied or independently created, then the nonce\ncould be accidentally reused in the other scheme leaking the secret key.\n\nThis proposal suggests to include the tag by prefixing the hashed data\nwith *SHA256(tag) \\|\\| SHA256(tag)*. Because this is a 64-byte long\ncontext-specific constant and the *SHA256* block size is also 64 bytes,\noptimized implementations are possible (identical to SHA256 itself, but\nwith a modified initial state). Using SHA256 of the tag name itself is\nreasonably simple and efficient for implementations that don\\'t choose\nto use the optimization.\n\n**Final scheme** As a result, our final scheme ends up using public key\n*pk* which is the X coordinate of a point *P* on the curve whose Y\ncoordinate is even and signatures *(r,s)* where *r* is the X coordinate\nof a point *R* whose Y coordinate is even. The signature satisfies *s\u22c5G\n= R + tagged_hash(r \\|\\| pk \\|\\| m)\u22c5P*."

This can be most reliably accomplished by not reusing the same\nprivate key across different signing schemes. For example, if the *rand*\nvalue was computed as per RFC6979 and the same secret key is used in\ndeterministic ECDSA with RFC6979, the signatures can leak the secret key\nthrough nonce reuse.\n\n**Nonce exfiltration protection** It is possible to strengthen the nonce\ngeneration algorithm using a second device. In this case, the second\ndevice contributes randomness which the actual signer provably\nincorporates into its nonce. This prevents certain attacks where the\nsigner device is compromised and intentionally tries to leak the secret\nkey through its nonce selection.\n\n**Multisignatures** This signature scheme is compatible with various\ntypes of multisignature and threshold schemes such as\n[MuSig](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/068), where a single public key\nrequires holders of multiple secret keys to participate in signing (see\nApplications below). **It is important to note that multisignature\nsigning schemes in general are insecure with the *rand* generation from\nthe default signing algorithm above (or any other deterministic\nmethod).**\n\n**Precomputed public key data** For many uses the compressed 33-byte\nencoding of the public key corresponding to the secret key may already\nbe known, making it easy to evaluate *has_even_y(P)* and *bytes(P)*.

      "content": "This document is the result of many discussions around Schnorr based\nsignatures over the years, and had input from Johnson Lau, Greg Maxwell,\nAndrew Poelstra, Rusty Russell, and Anthony Towns. The authors further\nwish to thank all those who provided valuable feedback and reviews,\nincluding the participants of the [structured\nreviews](https://github.com/ajtowns/taproot-review).\n\n[^1]: Informally, this means that without knowledge of the secret key\nbut given valid signatures of arbitrary messages, it is not possible\nto come up with further valid signatures.\n\n[^2]: A detailed security proof in the random oracle model, which\nessentially restates [the original security proof by Pointcheval and\nStern](https://www.di.ens.fr/~pointche/Documents/Papers/2000_joc.pdf)\nmore explicitly, can be found in [a paper by Kiltz, Masny and\nPan](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/191). All these security proofs\nassume a variant of Schnorr signatures that use *(e,s)* instead of\n*(R,s)* (see Design above). Since we use a unique encoding of *R*,\nthere is an efficiently computable bijection that maps *(R,s)* to\n*(e,s)*, which allows to convert a successful SUF-CMA attacker for\nthe *(e,s)* variant to a successful SUF-CMA attacker for the *(R,s)*\nvariant (and vice-versa). Furthermore, the proofs consider a variant\nof Schnorr signatures without key prefixing (see Design above), but\nit can be verified that the proofs are also correct for the variant\nwith key prefixing. As a result, all the aforementioned security\nproofs apply to the variant of Schnorr signatures proposed in this\ndocument.\n\n[^3]: If *(r,s)* is a valid ECDSA signature for a given message and key,\nthen *(r,n-s)* is also valid for the same message and key. If ECDSA\nis restricted to only permit one of the two variants (as Bitcoin\ndoes through a policy rule on the network), it can be\n[proven](https://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:hbz:294-60803)\nnon-malleable under stronger than usual assumptions.\n\n[^4]: The speedup that results from batch verification can be\ndemonstrated with the cryptography library\n[libsecp256k1](https://github.com/jonasnick/secp256k1/blob/schnorrsig-batch-verify/doc/speedup-batch.md).\n\n[^5]: A limitation of committing to the public key (rather than to a\nshort hash of it, or not at all) is that it removes the ability for\npublic key recovery or verifying signatures against a short public\nkey hash. These constructions are generally incompatible with batch\nverification.\n\n[^6]: Since *p* is odd, negation modulo *p* will map even numbers to odd\nnumbers and the other way around. This means that for a valid X\ncoordinate, one of the corresponding Y coordinates will be even, and\nthe other will be odd.\n\n[^7]: An earlier version of this draft used the third option instead,\nbased on a belief that this would in general trade signing\nefficiency for verification efficiency. When using Jacobian\ncoordinates, a common optimization in ECC implementations, it is\npossible to determine if a Y coordinate is a quadratic residue by\ncomputing the Legendre symbol, without converting to affine\ncoordinates first (which needs a modular inversion). As modular\ninverses and Legendre symbols have similar\n[performance](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2020-August/018081.html)\nin practice, this trade-off is not worth it.\n\n[^8]: This can be formalized by a simple reduction that reduces an\nattack on Schnorr signatures with implicit Y coordinates to an\nattack to Schnorr signatures with explicit Y coordinates. The\nreduction works by reencoding public keys and negating the result of\nthe hash function, which is modeled as random oracle, whenever the\nchallenge public key has an explicit Y coordinate that is odd. A\nproof sketch can be found\n[here](https://medium.com/blockstream/reducing-bitcoin-transaction-sizes-with-x-only-pubkeys-f86476af05d7).\n\n[^9]: Among other pitfalls, using the specification with a curve whose\norder is not close to the size of the range of the nonce derivation\nfunction is insecure.\n\n[^10]: The auxiliary random data is hashed (with a unique tag) as a\nprecaution against situations where the randomness may be correlated\nwith the private key itself. It is xored with the private key\n(rather than combined with it in a hash) to reduce the number of\noperations exposed to the actual secret key.\n\n[^11]: Including the [public key as input to the nonce\nhash](https://moderncrypto.org/mail-archive/curves/2020/001012.html)\nhelps ensure the robustness of the signing algorithm by preventing\nleakage of the secret key if the calculation of the public key *P*\nis performed incorrectly or maliciously, for example if it is left\nto the caller for performance reasons.\n\n[^12]: Note that in general, taking a uniformly random 256-bit integer\nmodulo the curve order will produce an unacceptably biased result.\nHowever, for the secp256k1 curve, the order is sufficiently close to\n*2^256^* that this bias is not observable (*1 - n / 2^256^* is\naround *1.27 \\* 2^-128^*).\n\n[^13]: Verifying the signature before leaving the signer prevents random\nor attacker provoked computation errors. This prevents publishing\ninvalid signatures which may leak information about the secret key.\nIt is recommended, but can be omitted if the computation cost is\nprohibitive."
