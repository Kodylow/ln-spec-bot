If it is satisfied by the public key nearest\nthe bottom of the execution stack, it is counted as twenty signature\noperations.\n-   Signature operations involving invalidly encoded signatures or\npublic keys are not counted towards the limit"

      "header": "Rationale",
      "content": "In the short term, an increase is needed to handle increasing\ntransaction volume.\n\nThe limits on signature operations and amount of signature hashing done\nprevent possible CPU exhaustion attacks by \\\"rogue miners\\\" producing\nvery expensive-to-validate two megabyte blocks. The signature hashing\nlimit is chosen to be impossible to reach with any non-attack\ntransaction or block, to minimize the impact on existing mining or\nwallet software.\n\nThe choices of constants for the deployment scheme were motivated by\nprior experience with upgrades to the Bitcoin consensus rules:\n\n-   0x10000000 was chosen to be compatible with the BIP 9 proposal for\nparallel deployment of soft forks\n-   75% was chosen instead of 95% to minimize the opportunity for a\nsingle large mining pool or miner to be able to veto an increase,\neither because of ideological opposition or threat of violence or\nextortion.\n-   A four-week grace period after the voting period was chosen as a\nbalance between giving people sufficient time to upgrade and keeping\npeople\\'s attention on the urgent need to upgrade."
